# `vis-lspc`

A language server protocol client for the [`vis` editor](https://github.com/martanne/vis).

## What's working

`vis-lspc` currently supports:
* `textDocument/completion`
* `textDocument/declaration`
* `textDocument/definition`
* `textDocument/references`
* `textDocument/typeDefinition`
* `textDocument/implementation`
* `textDocument/hover`
* `textDocument/rename`
* `textDocument/formatting`
* `[Diagnostics]`

## What's not working

Everything else.

To my knowledge there is currently no good way to detect file changes via the Lua API.
But this is essential to support [Text Synchronization](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#textSynchronization) which is required by the
LSP protocol.

A dirty workaround we currently use is to send the whole file content in a `textDocument/didChange`
method call before calling any other method.
If someone can come up with an idea how to solve this I would appreciate contributions.

Communicating with language-servers via other channels than stdin/stdout.

Currently, only a handful of language servers are configured by default.
Their configuration can be found in [`supported_servers.lua`](https://gitlab.com/muhq/vis-lspc/-/blob/main/supported-servers.lua).

## Requirements

* `vis` must offer the `communicate` Lua API
  * The API included in `vis` >= 0.9 is supported on the main branch
  * For legacy support using the [first API draft patches](https://github.com/martanne/vis/pull/675) use the v0.2.x branch
* The language server you want to use. [Microsoft's list of implementations](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/servers/)
* Optional: the JSON implementation of your choice
	* must provide `encode` and `decode` methods
	* `vis-lspc` tries to find a suitable JSON implementation using those candidates:
		* `json`
		* `cjson`
		* `dkjson`
		* bundled fallback (no utf8 support)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your `vis` plugins directory
2. Load the plugin in your `visrc.lua` with `require('plugins/vis-lspc')`

## Easy `vis-lspc` installation with `Guix 'R Us`

The [`Guix 'R Us`](https://git.sr.ht/~whereiseveryone/guixrus) channel provides a fork of `vis` with the [communicate](https://github.com/martanne/vis/pull/675) API patches applied. Additionally, `vis-lspc` is bundled for convenience.

After [adding `Guix 'R Us`](https://git.sr.ht/~whereiseveryone/guixrus#permanent) to your [`channels.scm`](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Using-a-Custom-Guix-Channel.html), run the following command to build and install `vis-lsp`:

`guix install vis-lsp`

Alternatively, you can clone `Guix 'R Us` and install from a local git checkout:

`git clone https://git.sr.ht/~whereiseveryone/guixrus`

`cd guixrus`

`guix install -L . vis-lsp`

## Usage

`vis-lspc` provides some default key bindings:

### Default Bindings

	Normal mode:
	<F2> - start a language server for win.syntax
	<F3> - open win.file with a running language server
	<C-]> | <gd> - jump to the definition of the symbol under the main cursor
	<gD> - jump to declaration
	<gd> - jump to definition
	<gi> - jump to implementation
	<gr> - show references
	< D> - jump to type definition
	<C-t> - go back in the jump history
	< e> - show diagnostics of current line
	<K> - hover over current position
	Normal and Insert mode:
	<C- > - get completions


### Available commands

	# language-server management:
	lspc-start-server [syntax] - start a language server for syntax or win.syntax
	lspc-stop-server [syntax] - stop the language server for syntax or win.syntax

	# file registration:
	lspc-open - register the file in the current window
	lspc-close - unregister the file in the current window

	# navigation commands (they all operate on the symbol under the main cursor):
	lspc-completion - syntax completion
	lspc-references [e | vsplit | hsplit] - select and open a reference
	lspc-declaration [e | vsplit | hsplit] - select and open a declaration
	lspc-definition [e | vsplit | hsplit] - open the definition
	lspc-typeDeclaration [e | vsplit | hsplit] - select and open a type declaration
	lspc-implementation [e | vsplit | hsplit] - I actually have no idea what this does

	lspc-back - navigate back in the goto history

	# workspace edits
	lspc-rename <new name> - rename the identifier under the cursor to <new name>
	lspc-format - format the file in the current window

	# development support
	lspc-hover - hover over the current line
	lspc-show-diagnostics - show the available diagnostics of the current line
	lspc-next-diagnostics - jump to the next available diagnostic
	lspc-prev-diagnostics - jump to the previous available diagnostic

### Available configuration options

The module table returned by `require('plugins/vis-lspc')` can be used to configure
some aspects of `vis-lspc`.

Available options are:

* `name = 'vis-lspc'` - the name `vis-lspc` introduces itself to a language server
* `logging = false` - enable logging only useful for debugging `vis-lspc`
* `log_file = nil` - nil, filename or function returning a filename
  * If `log_file` is `nil` `vis-lspc` will create a new file in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/vis-lspc`
* `autostart = true` - try to start a language server in WIN_OPEN
* `menu_cmd = 'fzf' or 'vis-menu'` - program to prompt for user choices
* `confirm_cmd = 'vis-menu'` - program to prompt for user confirmation
* `ls_map` - a table mapping `vis` syntax names to language server configurations
* `highlight_diagnostics = 'line'` - highlight the `range` or `line`number of available diagnostics
* `workspace_edit_remember_cursor = true` - restore the primary cursor position after a workspaceEdit
* `diagnostic_styles = { error = 'back:red', warning = 'back:yellow', information = 'back:yellow', hint = 'back:yellow', }` - styles used to highlight different diagnostics
* `show_message = 'message'` - how to present information. `'message'`: use `vis:message`; `'open'`: use a new window supporting syntax highlighting.
* `message_level = 3` - the level of shown messages retrieved via `window/showMessage` notifications

#### Configure your own Language Server

If `vis-lspc` has no language server configuration for your desired language or server
you have to create a language server configuration and insert it into the `ls_map`
table.
Please have a look at #2 and share your configuration with everyone else.

A language server configuration is a Lua table containing at least a `name` field
which is used to manage the language server and a `cmd` field which is used to
start the language server.

**Note:** the language server must communicate with `vis-lspc` via stdio.
Your language server probably supports stdio but maybe requires a [special
command line flag](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#implementationConsiderations).

Additional fields are:

* `settings` - a table of arbitrary possibly nested data. It is sent in a `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` to the language server after initialization. It is also used to lookup configuration for the `workspace/configuratio` method call.
* `init_options` - table of arbitrary possibly nested data. It will be sent to the server as `initializationOptions` in the parameters of the `initialize` method call.
* `formatting_options` - table of configuration data as found in [the LSP specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_formatting). `tabSize` and `insertSpaces` are required.

**Example:** The language server configuration entry in the `ls_map` for `lua-language-server`

```lua
ls_map.lua = {
  name = 'lua-language-server',
  cmd = 'lua-language-server',
  settings = {
    Lua = {diagnostics = {globals = {'vis'}}, telemetry = {enable = false}},
  },
  formatting_options = {tabSize = 2, insertSpaces = true},
},
```

Language servers configured in `vis-lspc` can be found in `supported_servers.lua`.

### Extensibility

The returned module table also includes functions you can use in your own `vis`
configuration.

#### `lspc.lspc_open`

Navigate between or in files, while remembering the current position in a runtime history.

```lua
lspc_open(win, path, line, col, cmd)
```

  - `win` - a window in which to open the file
  - `path` - the path to the file to open
  - `line` - the line to open. (`nil` for no position within the file).
  - `col` - same as `line`, but for the column.
  - `cmd` - `vis` command to open the file. (`e` or `o`, see `vis` commands)
